This Python program is designed to simulate Water Quality Tests using different data structures and operations. Each part of the solution demonstrates how to work with integers, arrays, lists, dictionaries, booleans, and strings in practical ways.
1. Integers
A list of integer test values (e.g., pH, turbidity, chlorine level) is created.
The program calculates the total, average, minimum, and maximum of these values to show how integers can be used for numerical analysis.
2. Arrays
A fixed-size numeric dataset is stored using Python’s built-in array module.
The sum of array elements is compared with the sum of a list to illustrate the difference between arrays and lists.
3. Lists
A list of water quality test names is created.
The program shows how to add a new test, remove one based on a condition, and sort the list.This demonstrates flexibility in managing collections of records.
4. Dictionaries
A list of dictionaries stores structured records for each test, with fields such as id, name, and value.One record is updated, another is deleted, and the program computes the total value across all records.This highlights how dictionaries store and manipulate structured data.
5. Booleans
A compound condition checks whether both the average and maximum values are above a given threshold.Depending on the condition, the program prints “Above Standard” or “Below Standard”.This shows how boolean logic is applied in decision-making.
6. Strings
A formatted report is created using f-strings.The report summarizes the results, including totals, averages, and the final status message.This demonstrates how to present results in a professional and readable way .
